== Idea

There is an address service which delivers addresses. This is the producer.
At the moment there is one Consumer which is an invoice service which can
produce invoices.

== Working with the code

To develop, run and build a JDK 8 is required. The build system is
https://gradle.org/[gradle].
The services are implemented with https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[spring boot].

=== Test the code

_cd_ into the directory of your checkout.

To test all services:

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew test # for linux
----

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew.bat test # for windows
----

=== Run address-service

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew :address-service:bootRun
----

TIP: `ctrl^c` ends the running spring boot server


=== Run invoice-service

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew :invoice-service:bootRun
----

== Working with the presentation

The link:presentation/src/docs/asciidoc/presentation.adoc[presentation] is written with http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]

To generate the presentation:

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew asciidoctor
----

afterwards you can present with a browser (here we are using firefox):

[listing]
----
$ firefox ./presentation/build/asciidoc/html5/presentation.html &
----
